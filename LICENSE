                       GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

    As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU
  Lesser General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3
  of the GNU General Public License.

    "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
  other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

    An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface
  provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the
  Library.  Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is
  deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.

    A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
  Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
  with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
  Version".

    The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
  Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
  for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
  based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

    The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
  object code and/or source code for the Application, including any
  data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work
  from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the
  Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

    You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this
  License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

    If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
  facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an
  Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed
  when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the
  modified version:

    a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort
    to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
    function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
    whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

    b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
    this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

    The object code form of an Application may incorporate material
  from a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such
  object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the
  incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data
  structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions
  and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the
  following:

    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that
    the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
    covered by this License.

    b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this
    license document.

  4. Combined Works.

    You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
  taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
  portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
  engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
  the following:

    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
    the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
    covered by this License.

    b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and
    this license document.

    c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
    execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
    these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
    copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

    d) Do one of the following:

        0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of
        this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
        suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
        recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
        the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
        manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
        Corresponding Source.

        1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
        Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
        a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
        system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
        of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
        Version.

    e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
    be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU
    GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to
    install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work
    produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a
    modified version of the Linked Version.  (If you use option 4d0,
    the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal
    Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code.  If you
    use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in
    the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
    Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

    You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
  Library side by side in a single library together with other library
  facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
  License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
  choice, if you do both of the following:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
    is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
    accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time.
  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
  Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
  of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
  applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that published version or of any later version
  published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library as you
  received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU
  Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software
  Foundation.

    If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can
  decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public
  License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of
  any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that
- version for the Library.

                       GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
